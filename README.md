# Python Package Template

An opinionated template repository for making python packages.

Places you need to make changes, generally replacing `your_package_name` or `your-package-name`:

- [ ] `setup.py`
- [ ] this `README.md`
- [ ] `your_package_name` folder which contains your source files
- [ ] `.github/workflows/main.yml` which runs the main CI flow
- [ ] `.github/workflows/release.yml` which pushes out a release once a release is published

Don't forget to add some badges once CI is running and you've published to PyPI (https://badge.fury.io/for/py)
